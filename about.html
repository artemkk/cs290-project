        <h3>About Respira Steakhouse</h3>
        <p class="about-text">A quality and relaxing rural country steakhouse, run by award winning owners, in the
            beautiful
            Berkshire village of Peasemore just a
            short drive from the A34 and junctions 13 and 14 of the M4. The building and decor are charming and rustic,
            with
            elegant modern touches.
            Relax by the cozy log burner perfect for winter evenings or enjoy outdoor seating overlooking open country
            fields or in a pretty courtyard filled
            with flowers in the summer months. A daily menu, all freshly prepared in the pub kitchen, includes fresh
            fish,
            pies, steaks and chef's daily specials
            with main course prices ranging from £11.50 - £19.50. As all dishes are prepared in the kitchen, they
            are
            able to cater for most dietary needs, with
            most sauces, soups and gravy all created gluten free. The Fox also offers gluten free bread and gluten free
            Yorkshire puddings on a Sunday.</p>
